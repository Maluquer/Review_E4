Leifsson et al. 2024;2024;Secondary Tree growth ;tree rings - annual;YES - moving correlations;drought index as a climate variable to account for the combined effects of temperature and water availability ;Not studied, just pattern;Physiological mechanisms;Dendrochronology;Beech;Europe;;;;drought sensitivity is highly variable and non-stationary, though consistently higher at dry sites compared to moist sites. Increasing drought sensitivity can largely be explained by increasing climatic aridity, especially as it is exacerbated by climate change and trees' rank progression within forest communities, as (co-)dominant trees are more sensitive to extra-canopy climatic conditions than trees embedded in understories. However, during the driest periods of the 20th century, growth showed clear signs of being decoupled from climate. This may indicate fundamental changes in system behavior and be early-warning signals of decreasing drought tolerance.

These results highlight the potential negative impact of global climate change on our capacity to predict stand productivity accurately, especially if climate-sensitive growth models are based on projections of future monthly metrics. Because adverse climatic events are expected to increase both in frequency and in severity over the next decades, a general decrease in the growth rate of sugar maple is apprehended in southern

ESTO NO ES DE ESTE PAPER -->Using tree-ring climatology method and non-linear models based on maximum likelihood analysis etc., the relationship between the tree-ring growth and competition index and climatic factors and their relative importance were evaluated in different years-interval and climate-zone. The results showed that the competitive effect for trees growth was always much stronger than the climatic or size effect. Competitive effects change over time, with drought effects (vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI)) on tree growth exacerbated. The significant negative effects of neighborhood competition gradually increased over time. Climate moderates competitive effects during stand development, especially the negative effects of drought index on trees. Trees decline in growth due to climate warming with temperature and precipitation changes, and mainly, increased competition. Overall, these results constitute important new information, which not only further deepe

Drought fluorescence monitoring index (DFMI) was developed to examine the relationship between vegetation NEP and drought response based on the solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data. Our results suggested that vegetation carbon sinks increased significantly at 7.09 g C m?2 yr?1 in NWC during 2000–2019, mainly in northern Shaanxi, eastern and southern Gansu, and southern Ningxia. NEP showed increasing trends under different climatic zones and land cover types, but there were differences in carbon sink capacity.is study emphasizes the demand to rapidly identify climatic conditions that lead to decrease significantly in vegetation carbon sinks and to formulate adaptation strategies aimed at reducing drought risk under global warming
